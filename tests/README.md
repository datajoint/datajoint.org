# Testing and Local Setup

This directory is a placeholder until we have a more polished QA process. For now, it will contain useful notes to help understand necessary pre-requisites for interfaces and any supplemental context info to help establish a proper local setup.

## Usage Tracking Schema Design

Tables were generated by DataJoint (to facilitate query/analysis for all). Currently, this schema is located in `tutorial-db.datajoint.io`.

Below are the definitions:

```python
schema = dj.Schema('usage_data')

@schema
class Install(dj.Manual):
    definition = """
    # Usage data install submissions
    install_id: serial # unique ID
    ---
    install_user: varchar(25) # DataJoint Auth user
    install_operating_system: varchar(20) # Operating system the user is running
    install_mac_address: varchar(17) # MAC address of the machine
    install_platform: varchar(20) # Ecosystem utilized in e.g. Python, MATLAB
    install_platform_version: varchar(15) # Ecosystem version e.g. 3.8, R2018b
    install_package_manager: varchar(20) # Package manager for the ecosystem in e.g. conda, pip, FEX, ghtb
    install_package_manager_version: varchar(25) # Version for the package manager e.g. 4.8.2, 20.1.1
    install_package_name: varchar(30) # Package library name
    install_package_version: varchar(15) # Package library version
    install_city: varchar(30) # IP-based Geographic City
    install_region: varchar(30) # IP-based Geographic Region
    install_country: varchar(30) # IP-based Geographic Country
    install_geo_timezone: varchar(30) # IP-based Geographic Timezone
    install_sys_timezone: varchar(20) # System configured Timezone
    install_initiated_date: datetime # UTC time install initiated
    install_completed_date: datetime # UTC time install completed
    install_dj_experience=null: float # Years of DataJoint experience
    """

@schema
class Event(dj.Manual):
    definition = """
    # Usage event logs per installation
    -> Install
    event_date: datetime(3) # Date event occurred
    ---
    event_type: varchar(40) # Type of event that occurred
    """
```
